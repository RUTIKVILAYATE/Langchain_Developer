Abstract- Analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data is pivotal for understanding brain function and diagnosing 
neurological disorders. However, conventional approaches often struggle with the intricate nonlinear and dynamic 
characteristics of EEG signals. This study introduces Liquid Time Constant (LTC) networks, a novel deep learning 
architecture tailored for time-series analysis in EEG data. LTC networks offer several advantages over traditional methods. 
Their unique liquid time constant mechanism enables adaptive capture of temporal dependencies, resulting in enhanced 
performance for tasks such as signal classification and prediction. Furthermore, their inherent stability and bounded 
behavior make them particularly suitable for real-time applications.
