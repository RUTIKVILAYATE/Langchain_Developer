# Ollama -> Open Source Platform where we can able to use open source models like 
# Llama3, Phi 3, Mistral, Gemma and other models 
# Basically we can download ollama in local machine in which we download models and can run within it 



# Download Ollama -> approx. 275 mb
# Open command prompt -> ollama run gemma:2b -> it will download this model if not present in local machine else it will run the model directly
# we can chat with it in the command line itself -> as it is a llm trained by google and can make conversation
